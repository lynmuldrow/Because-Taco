# Because-Taco

Do you long for a funny taco gif at random intervals? Having a non Taco Tuesday day? 

This is a Google Chrome extension where you install, click the taco button, and BAM- tacos. Click the button again to hide the taco gif funnies. 

Fork and make something amazingly cool. Here's the app if you want it: http://bit.ly/1CsT91w

Enjoy!
